*   `nova evacuate` does *not* do evacuation
*   `nova evacuate` does resurrection
*   In Vancouver, `nova` developers considered a rename
    *    Hasn't happened yet
    *    Due to impact, seems unlikely to happen any time soon
    *    <span class="fg-dark-green">
           Whenever you see “*evacuate*” in a nova-related context,
           pretend you saw “*resurrect*” </span>
