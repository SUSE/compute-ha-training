# Compute HA presentation

This repo contains the source code for presentation slides about High
Availability (HA) for compute nodes within
[OpenStack](http://openstack.org/) clouds.

It is based on
[a template by Adam Spiers](https://github.com/aspiers/presentation-template/)
which is in turn based on
[a template by Florian Haas](https://github.com/fghaas/presentation-template/)
which uses [`reveal.js`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) (by
Hakim El-Hattab and contributors) as the underlying presentation
technology.

**You can
[view the slides online](http://aspiers.github.io/compute-ha-presentation/)
