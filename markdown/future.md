## Future work

*   Interlock in Austin with developers and Product Working Group
*   "Best of breed" solution
*   Harden `nova evacuate` API and expose progress
*   Implement CI integration testing for failure cases
*   Create new specs repository and submit specs

Note:

-   `nova evacuate` API progress could work similar to
    `nova live-migration` progress
